      question: 'What is NFC marketing?',
      answer:
        'NFC (Near Field Communication) lets people tap their phones on a product or item to instantly access digital content - no apps, no QR codes, no friction. It is the same technology that you use Apple or Google Pay.',
      category: 'Technology',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need a special app to view the experiences?',
      answer:
        "Nope! All of our experiences work directly through the phone's browser - just tap or scan and you're in. No downloads, no delays.",
      category: 'Technology',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use a QR code instead of NFC?',
      answer:
        'Yes! Every experience we build can also be accessed via a custom QR code if you prefer.',
      category: 'Technology',
    },
    {
      question: 'What kind of content can I link to my NFC products?',
      answer:
        'We offer everything from simple swipeable portfolios to immersive 360° videos, 3D product demos, interactive games, AR filters, and even full VR worlds. You dream it - we build it.',
      category: 'Content',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use my own designs or branding?',
      answer:
        'Absolutely. You can upload your existing artwork, videos, logos, and brand colours. Need a hand? We also offer optional design and 3D logo services.',
      category: 'Customization',
    },
    {
      question: 'What kind of products can be NFC-enabled?',
      answer:
        'Just about anything! Popular items include: T-shirts, hoodies, mugs, and hats; Posters, fliers, vinyls, and business cards; Product packaging, event wristbands, or gift boxes. If it can be printed on or worn, we can probably chip it.',
      category: 'Products',
    },
    {
      question: 'Will this work at events or on the street?',
      answer:
        'Yes! Our tech is perfect for live events, pop-ups, launches, and guerrilla marketing. People can tap posters, scan t-shirts, or interact with merchandise right there and then.',
      category: 'Events',
    },
    {
      question: 'How much does hosting cost?',
      answer:
        "Hosting is free for up to 2,500 unique users per month. After that, it's just £20/month for every additional 2,500 users. There are no hidden fees - just simple, scalable pricing as your audience grows.",
      category: 'Pricing',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I track how people interact with my experience?',
      answer:
        "Yes! Our mid- and top-tier packages include analytics and interaction tracking. You'll see how many people tapped, how long they engaged, and what they clicked on.",
      category: 'Analytics',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you offer white-label or partner solutions?',
      answer:
        "We do. Whether you're an agency, brand, or creative studio, we can build immersive campaigns that carry your name, not ours. Get in touch for a partner pack.",
      category: 'Partnership',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does it take to launch?',
      answer:
        "Turnaround times vary by complexity: Basic projects: 7–10 days; Custom immersive builds: 2–4 weeks; Full VR/AR experiences: 4–8 weeks. We'll confirm your timeline during the onboarding call.",
      category: 'Timeline',
    },
    {
      question:
        'Do I need a network or internet connection for it to work?',
      answer:
        "Yes, your audience will need an internet connection (Wi-Fi or mobile data) to view the experience. But it's designed to load fast and run smoothly - even on standard mobile connections.",
      category: 'Technical',
    },
    {
      question: 'Will my customers need mobile data to use it?',
      answer:
        "Yes - but only a small amount. Most experiences are lightweight and stream over the web, just like visiting a website or watching a short video. If you're planning to use this in a remote or offline setting, let us know - we can offer alternative solutions like preloaded offline versions for VR.",
      category: 'Technical',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I update the experience after it goes live?',
      answer:
        'Yes! Our experiences can include dynamic content updates. That means you can change your videos, links, or assets anytime - without needing to reprint your product or merch.',
      category: 'Updates',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can you help me come up with ideas for my campaign?',
      answer:
        "Definitely. We're not just tech providers - we're creatives too. We'll help you brainstorm campaign ideas, interactive storylines, and how to use immersive content to wow your audience and meet your goals.",
